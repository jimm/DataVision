v1.2.0, ??/??/2008  Frank W. Zammetti  <fzlists@omnytex.com>

    * Fixed live database example report.  Rather than recreate the database,
      which requires me to find my quick-hack code, I instead removed the
      firstName field from the report to avoid the field not found warning
      on load.  So, the report maybe looks a little funny, but no warning,
      so that's good :)

    * Switched to modified .bat and .sh files, courtesy of Jonathan Marsden.

    * Applied patch #1872989 from Arno Peters that dealt with the look & feel
      stuff (I made a booboo!)  Thanks Arno!

    * Corrected mistakes in a few language files where it said "CSS-based XLS"
      instead of the correct "CSS-based HTML" export option and layout engine
      specification.  Also added that string to one file that was missing it.

    * Addressed issue reported by Byron Hurder dealing with SQLite not showing
      database columns.  Also as part of this, added new sqlite_example.xml
      report, and test database (unfortunately the database has to be in the
      root directory rather than /examples where I'd prefer it be, just so
      that it can be found when DataVision is run... might just need to
      specify the path differentlyin the connection string, but nothing I
      tried seem to work, so we'll live with the file being somewhere it
      would be better off not being).

    * DataVision now by default uses the Liquid look and feel, as seen here:
      https://liquidlnf.dev.java.net.  Optionally, you can pass the new -u
      command line parameter to specify the L&F (value is either "default"
      for the Swing default L&F or "liquid" for the new Liquid L&F).

    * Bug #865491 was fixed.  Check SVN commit messages on 12/23/2007 for
      details (a bunch of files needed to be modified to address this).
      Commit message is also a part of the bug ticket for reference.

    * Applied patch #1816739 from Marcel Jager who provided Dutch translations.
      Thank you Marcel!

    * Applied patch #1463294 from David Bennett do address an issue when using
      JavaScript as your formula language.  Thanks David!

    * Added the ObjectSource and related example code.  This allows you to run
      a report against an ArrayList (where each element is a row) of
      ArrayLists (where each element is a column).  This works very much like
      CharSepSource does, except that you define the data, as well as the
      columns, in code.  See the example for usage details.

v1.1.0, 12/05/2007  Frank W. Zammetti  <fzlists@omnytex.com>

    * I'm reinstating this file because while it's true that the
      Subversion check-in notes convey the same information, at least
      99% of the time, I feel it is nice for people not interested in
      looking at those notes to still have a place they can look to see
      what changed from version to version.  I'm also modifying this
      file slightly in that instead of breakout by date, it will be
      broken down  by version/release date now.  That way a person can
      at a glance see what changed in the latest version.

    * Modified DOS batch startup file surrounding entire %classpath%
      on execution line with quotes and removed quotes from env var
      setting line... this should deal with long filenames in the
      classpath properly in all cases.

    * Applied patch #1463120 from David Bennett to eliminate NPE when
      copying report connection from existing report file and updated
      credits file.

    * Added a new "all_plus_jar" target to the build script and made it
      the default... this just called the "all" target, and then the
      "jar" target, which to me is the more useful typical sequence
      during development... I guess when someone else is contributing
      we can debate it then :)  It also calls the clean target first.

    * Upgraded all libraries.  BSF upgraded to version 2.4.0 (required addition
      of Jakarta Commons Logging, version 1.1).  jRuby upgraded to
      version 0.9.8 (required addition of ASM, version 2.2.3.  jCalendar
      upgraded to version 1.3.2.  iText upgraded to version 2.0.1 (required
      changed to PDFLE.java because compiler error occurred catching
      DocumentException on call to doc.newPage()... see comment in source for
      full details).  Also added libraries to startup batch file and script.

    * Applied patch #1328189 from Steve Kennedy to deal with overlapping
      header/footer sections.

    * Applied patch #1465505 from David Bennett adding XLS export support
      based on the Excel layout engine from Dean Beeler.  Patch required
      one change due to a deprecated method in POI (HSSFCell.setValue()
      no longer accepts a String, you need to wrap it in a HSSFRichTextString
      object now).

    * Applied patch #1619924 from Lendle Tseng to allow handling of CJK fonts
      in the PDF layout engine.

    * Fixed the file empty_charsep.xml.  There was a missing comment terminator,
      so it wasn't well-formed XML, so anyone trying to use it would have run
      into an error.

    * Applied patch #1462884 from David Bennett, with some modifications, to
      add support for specifying a starting report open directory and a default
      output directory from the command line, and also saving these settings
      using the JDK Preferences facility for future use.  Also update
      documentation for this, as well as some other things that were missing.

    * Added a test report that runs against a Derby database, which is also
      added.  This allows a person the ability to immediately open an example
      report going against a real database without having to set anything up
      themselves.  Derby is added to the classpath so it'll just work.

    * Added debug options to all javac tasks in build file.  We weren't getting
      line numbers, which was making debugging a lot harder.  Anyone who wants
      optimal performance should build from source with those options removed.

    * Applied patch #1552277 which implements the CSS-based HTML layout engine
      from David Bennett.  I renamed it CSSHTMLLE, but otherwiwse it's
      unchanged.  Also updated all Datavision_*.properties files to include
      both the XLS (which was missed) and CSSHTML layout engines in the export
      dialog.  Some of the languages aren't correct for these two options, but
      better they be there in English than missing entirely I figured.  All
      documentation updated to reflect CSSHTML layout engine as well.

    * A datavision_version.txt file is now included in the DataVision JAR.
      There previously was no easy way to tell what version of the JAR you
      had in a project, this serves that purpose.

	* jimm/datavision/Parameter.java (getValue): rewrote (yet again!)
	to return number of values based on arity, not on size of value
	list.

2002-06-03  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.3.3 released.

2002-05-29  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Query.java (setParameters): turn java.util.Dates
	into java.sql.Dates when filling the prepared statement. Hopefully
	this will fix the problem Miguel saw with Oracle and date
	parameters.

	* jimm/datavision/layout/XMLLE.java (ctor): new constructor takes
	encoding string. Default value is Report.XML_ENCODING_ATTRIBUTE.

	* jimm/datavision/PaperFormat.java: created.

	* jimm/datavision/Format.java (clone): a new clone shouldn't be
	dirty.

2002-05-02  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java (reset): call
	initializeConnection after closing old connection.

	* jimm/datavision/layout/SwingLE.java (cancel): created.

	use TreeMap to sort the fields.
	(createFormulas): ditto.

	finds subtotals fields.

2002-04-27  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	wrap messages that are too long.

2002-04-25  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/layout/DocBookLE.java: made a subclass of
	SortedLayoutEngine.

	* jimm/datavision/ReportReader.java: removed the empty, useless
	initialize method.

2002-04-23  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	SortedLayoutEngine.

	* jimm/datavision/layout/XMLLE.java: now a subclass of
	SortedLayoutEngine.

2002-04-22  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Section.java: stop storing fields in a map;
	store them n a list instead. Ths preserves the order of the
	fields, important to character-based layout engines.

	* jimm/datavision/Query.java: stop storing sorts in a map; store
	their columns and order strings in lists instead. This preserves
	the order of the sorts, though the code is uglier.

	* Version 0.2.2 released.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java (initializeConnection): show
	errors to user when logging in.

	* jimm/datavision/ParameterReader.java (readFile): use an
	InputStreamReader that uses an encoding of UTF-8.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/ExportWin.java (runReport): remove calls to
	flush and close output. Since we run reports in a separate thread
	now, this is a bad thing to do. Let the layout engine close its
	output (as it has always done anyway).

	* Removed jimm/datavision/gui/ReportRunner.java: it was useless.

	* jimm/datavision/Formula.java (setEvalString): don't start
	observing contents (other formulas within this formula) yet. We
	may be reading the formula from XML and may not have read all
	other formulas into memory yet.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (writeFile): filter output through
	an OutputStreamWriter and set the encoding to UTF-8.
	(writeXML): save the encoding in the XML preprocessing
	instruction.

	* Version 0.2.1 released.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (runReport): call
	LayoutEngine.wantsMoreData before each row.

	* jimm/datavision/LayoutEngine.java (wantsMoreData): created.

	* jimm/datavision/layout/SwingLE.java (close): set wantsMoreData
	to false when this window is closed so the report can stop
	retrieving rows of data.

2002-04-21  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Row.java: created so we can start
	abstracting data row implementations.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/ResultSetRow.java: created as concrete
	implementation of the new Row class. Additionally, we no longer
	rely upon newer v1.2 ResultSet calls.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/SubtotalsWin.java (createNewSubtotal): fix
	bug by making sure we use the id of the original field being
	subtotaled.

	* jimm/datavision/SubtotalField.java (getFieldId): created to
	return the id of the field we are subtotaling.

2002-04-20  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java (loadAllTables): use database
	name when retrieving tables. Will no longer see other tables; for
	example, PostgreSQL "pg_*" tables won't display. Use empty name if
	you want all tables.

2002-04-19  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/gui/HelpURLStack.java: created.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/HelpWin.java: new navigation toolbar.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java: removed code that compared
	contents of old and new connection's tables and columns. It
	doesn't make sense; there might be a table with the same name in
	two completely different database schemas.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Table.java: ditto.

	* everywhere: moved all "find" and "findName" methods into Report.
	These methods returned objects that were found by id or name. If
	multiple reports were open, there would be id clashes. Moving
	everything into Report fixes the problem.

2002-04-18  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.2.0 released.

	* jimm/datavision/layout/SwingPage.java (getPreferredSize):
	created because having a null layout means never having to say
	you're sorry^W^W^W^Wa preferred size.
	(setPreferredSize): created for the same kumquat^Wreason.

	* jimm/datavision/layout/SwingLE.java: major changes: display one
	page at a time, added toolbar, more.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/MenuUtils.java (setKeys): broken out from
	addMenuItem.

2002-04-17  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	reports in a separate thread.
	(run): run reports in a separate thread.

	* Removed jimm/datavision/sql/JDBC.java; moved code into
	Database.java.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (setParameterXMLFile): created.
	(askForParameters): read parameter XML file.

	* jimm/datavision/Field.java: rid this class of the "dirty"

	number.
	(containsReferenceTo(Parameter)): ask the query, too.

	* jimm/datavision/Query.java (containsReferenceTo): created.

	* jimm/datavision/ReportReader.java: changed default DTD version
	number to the current value, 0.2.

	(printType): use varchar2 instead of varchar.

2002-03-31  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Parameter.java (getDefaultValue): if no default
	value assigned, create and return -- but do not store -- a new
	one.

2002-03-30  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jcalendar.jar: added.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/parameter/*Inq.java: created;

	records retrieved by query.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DropListenerTextArea.java (drop): accept

	window associated with a report.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DbPasswordDialog.java (constructor): take
	parent Frame.

	* jimm/datavision/Query.java (getWhereClause): substitute
	parameter values before returning the where clause text.
	(toString): use where clause accessor so parameter values get
	substituted.

2002-03-28  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java: separate connection
	initialization from the accessor method.

	* jimm/datavision/DataVision.java (main): move try/catch block
	around DesignWin creation as well as headless report running. We
	weren't catching IllegalArgumentExceptions thrown during report
	creation.

	* jimm/datavision/Parameter.java: added boolean type.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/EditWinWidget.java (mouseClicked): call
	superclass version if we don't handle the click here.

2002-03-26  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/gui/parameter/ParamEditWin.java: created.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/SectionWidget.java (makeWidgetFor): create a
	parameter widget when appropriate.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/ParameterWidget.java: created.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/EditWinWidget.java: created to act as
	abstract superclass of ParameterWidget and FormulaWidget.

2002-02-10  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Utils.java (escapeSQL): added this method to
	double single quote characters. (NOTE: commented out because it

2002-02-09  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Parameter.java (dragString): don't pass all
	ivars; just pass id number.

	* jimm/datavision/Parameter.java: added arity.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/HelpWin.java: created.

	* Makefile (all): add dependency upon html-docs so help files get
	built.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java: added new Help menu and
	about box.

2002-02-08  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.1.9 released.

	* jimm/datavision/ReportReader.java (convertFormulas): trap bad
	formula errors and report error to user.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FormulaWin.java (save): trap bad formula
	errors and report error to user.

	* jimm/datavision/Formula.java (getEditableEvalString): rewritten
	to fix horrendously incorrect code.
	(setEditableEvalString): ditto.

2002-02-05  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Field.java: added refersTo(Parameter).

	* jimm/datavision/FormulaField.java: added refersTo(Parameter).

	* jimm/datavision/Formula.java: added refersTo(Parameter).

	* jimm/datavision/Section.java: added refersTo(Parameter).

	* jimm/datavision/SubtotalField.java: added refersTo(Parameter).

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FieldPickerWin.java: added parameter methods
	'n stuff.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FPLeafInfo.java: uncommented ParameterInfo.

	* jimm/datavision/layout/SwingPage.java (print): use PageFormat's
	size when printing.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java: enable "Parameter Field..."
	menu item.

	* jimm/datavision/SubtotalField.java (canSubtotal): return true
	for parameter fields referencing numeric parameters.

2002-02-04  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Formula.java: now handles parameters.

	* jimm/datavision/Parameter.java: created.

	* jimm/datavision/StringParameter.java: created.

	* jimm/datavision/NumericParameter.java: created.

	* jimm/datavision/DateParameter.java: created.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FieldWidget.java: fixed field selection
	logic.

2002-02-02  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/SubtotalField.java (canSubtotal): return false
	if the field's section is null (for example, we are dragging).

	* jimm/datavision/testdata/SchemaGen.java: rewritten to use MinML.
	Because of the change, this file also compiles and runs now.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java: removed draggedFields list
	because it is really the same as selectedFields.

2002-01-31  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FieldWidget.java: removed old, commented-
	out code that is no longer necessary.

2002-01-30  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/ReportReader.java: totally rewritten to use the
	MinML XML parser.

	* jimm/datavision/Section.java (setIsDetail): added because of the
	new way we parse XML.

	* Version 0.1.8 released.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java (addTitleField): forgot to
	add the new title field to the report section; it's now added.

2002-01-28  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/layout/SwingPage.java (print): changed call from
	paintComponent to paint. Printing now works.

2002-01-24  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Field.java (toString): pass value to formatted()
	as object, not as string.
	(formatted): accept an object. Based on object type, use the
	format string along with a SimpleDateFormat or DecimalFormat
	object.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FormatWin.java (buildFormatTab): cleaned up
	widget layout.

	* Version 0.1.7 released.

2002-01-23  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java (getConnection): print SQL
	error number and message to System.err.

	* jimm/datavision/SubtotalField.java (initialize): new method that
	resets the subtotal's value. Called by the report at the beginning
	of each run.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (collectSubtotalFields): give each
	subtotal field a chance to clear itself by calling its initialize
	method.

2002-01-22  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* everywhere: changed all floats to doubles and Floats to Doubles.

2002-01-21  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/testdata/*: new schema.xml and SchemaGen.java;
	postgres, oracle, and mysql dirs now use new <dbname>SchemaGen
	classes which subclass SchemaGen and generate schema.sql from
	schema.xml.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (run): changed logic so layout
	engine's start() method is called after the first record is read
	from the database. This allows database columns to appear in the
	report header and first page header.

2002-01-20  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.1.6 released.

	* jimm/datavision/BorderEdge.java: removed STYLE_NONE; it's
	useless.

	* jimm/datavision/Border.java (eachLine): remove STYLE_NONE check,
	add edge count check.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FormatWin.java: pulled edge names into an
	array of strings. Added support for edge style and thickness.
	(sizeChoices): renamed from initSizeChoices; now called whenever
	list is required instead of just once in one special place.

	* jimm/datavision/ReportReader.java (line): fixed code that reads
	the end points of the line: the search for the second "point" tag
	was misplaced.

2002-01-19  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FormatWin.java (addBool): fixed a bug that
	was mis-setting the shortcut (mnemonic) key for all check boxes.
	(buildBorderTab): borders were displayed in wrong locations (for
	example bottom border was displayed at left of dialog).

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DbPasswordDialog.java: ask for user name as
	well as password.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (run): don't need local rset
	ResultSet variable; just use instance variable of the same name.
	(processResultRow): don't need to pass in rset, since it's an
	instance variable.
	(askForPassword): changed logic: retrieves database username and
	password and hands them to the database.

	* jimm/datavision/ReportReader.java (readFile): was clearing dirty
	bit too early: later calls to ensureNotEmpty were re-setting the
	report's dirty bit.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java (constructor): fixed logic
	when user cancels so we close properly.
	(readReport): signal cancellation of password dialog by catching
	the IllegalArgumentException and setting the report to null.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DbConnWin.java (doSave): simplify error
	message; don't say "perhaps the password is incorrect".

	* jimm/datavision/sql/JDBC.java (constructor): separate illegal
	arg exceptions and add messages explaining the problem.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java (setUserName): make sure user
	name is never null; use "" instead.
	(getConnection): changed logic for obtaining password; also
	obtains username and retries (asks user for username and password
	again) if a SQLException is thrown.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DbPasswordDialog.java: display "" if the
	user name is null.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java (loadAllTables): changed
	second arg to DatabaseMetaData.getTables from "" to null. This
	improves Oracle support: null returns tables from all schemas,
	which is what we want. Apparently, "" returns tables within the
	schema named "", thus no tables are returned.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Table.java (loadColumns): changed second arg
	to DatabaseMetaData.getColumns from "" to null. This improves
	Oracle support: "" doesn't return any columns, null does.

2002-01-18  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (askForPassword): Don't print
	newline after prompt.

	* jimm/datavision/DataVision.java: added error messages to calls
	to usage(). Stop requiring password on command line.
	(usage): fixed usage string; added output of error message;
	usage() now exits at the end.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java (deleteSelectedFieldsAnd):
	clear selected fields list before deleting fields, because
	otherwise we were trying to use these deleted fields when
	responding to an update from a deleted field.
	(readReport): pass database password in to this routine; hand it
	to report before reading file.

	* jimm/datavision/BorderEdge.java (toString): added for debugging.
	(styleFromString): return STYLE_LINE, not STYLE_NONE, if the style
	string is null.

	* jimm/datavision/layout/LaTeXLE.java (drawLine): y slope had the
	wrong sign.

	* jimm/datavision/SubtotalField.java (updateSubtotal): now handles
	all numeric types (not just Float values) properly, and attempts
	to convert strings into floats.

2002-01-17  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Field.java (toString): handle null values by
	returning "".

	* jimm/datavision/gui/SubtotalsWin.java (createNewSubtotal):
	handle null format in original field by using Format.DEFAULT.

2002-01-16  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.1.5 released.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/SQLQueryWin.java: new code factored out of
	DesignWin.java. Text widget now made un-editable (though selecting
	and copying is still allowed).

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FieldPickerTree.java
	(dragGestureRecognized): don't try dragging strings (non-leaf
	nodes), just leaf nodes.

	* jimm/datavision/Section.java: now observable and also observers
	of fields.

	* jimm/datavision/Query.java (toString): if there are no tables or
	fields used by the query, return an empty string (instead of
	"select from ").

	* jimm/datavision/Group.java (setValue): use equals() instead of
	"==" to compare values. Group headers were being improperly
	triggered because the same values (for example, Integer instances)
	were "equal() but not "==".

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java: made observer of sections so
	we can trigger menu item changes more easily and reliably.
	(showSQL): factored out code into new SQLQueryWin class.
	(update): made self observer and added this method. Now updates
	menu items on all received updates.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (processResultRow): changed to
	protected void instead of public boolean because I'm no longer
	using StatementHandler (don't bother looking for that either
	because it's not there).
	(countTablesUsed): added to report number of tables used by query;
	useful when the GUI is enabling/disabling menu items.

2002-01-15  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.1.4 released.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/NewGroupWin.java (buildGuts): fixed bad
	layout code.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/SQLQueryWin.java: created this new class
	from code factored out of DesignWin.showSQL. Fixed code that
	inserts newlines into SQL.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (hasFields): returns true if there
	is at least one field used by the report. Used to determine when
	to enable some menu items.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java (showSQL): factored out code
	into new SQLQueryWin class.
	(enableMenuItems): only enable "Group..." insert menu item if
	there is at least one field in the report.

	* jimm/datavision/Query.java (toString): fixed SQL query building
	logic. There was a fatal logic error: if the report had no joins
	or where clause, the code to build the "order by" clause was
	skipped.

2002-01-13  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.1.3 released.

2002-01-12  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Query.java (removeSort): only set dirty bit if
	the column is already in the sort list.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (isGroupColumn): added so we can
	determine if a column is a group's column.
	(addGroup): remove the group's column from the query's sort list.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/SortWin.java (fillListModels): ignore group
	columns so the user can't sort by them (because the group defines
	the sort order).

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FormatWin.java (doSave): font size was being
	extracted from the dropdown menu incorrectly, preventing font
	sizes from being changed.

	* jimm/datavision/Query.java (findColumnsUsed): prevent columns
	from appearing more than once in the SQL query.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FormatWin.java: font size wasn't being
	retrieved from dropdown menu properly.

2002-01-10  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java: instead of forcing DbConnWin
	to front, make it modal and open it before opening self. If a
	report's database password or connection info dialog box is
	cancelled by the user, the report is not opened or created and, if
	this was the first/only report, the application quits.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DbConnWin.java: added modal parameter to
	constructor.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/EditWin.java: added a new constructor that
	lets subclasses declare modal state.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/WindowRaiser.java: removed because the
	dialog for which this was necessary is now opened as a modal
	dialog before the design window.

	* Version 0.1.2 released.

	* jimm/datavision/docs/web: new directory containing contents of
	the DataVision Web site, minus the User's Manual.

	* jimm/datavision/docs/Makefile: added "web" target that generates
	HTML, copies it into the "web" subdirectory, and creates a tarball
	of the whole thing.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java (loadAllTables): when
	reloading (user changed connection information), don't throw away
	old table and column objects. Instead, reuse them and report back
	if any old tables are missing.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Table.java: removed method clearAllTables.
	(loadColumns): check for missing columns when reloading after
	database connection info changed.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java: removed unnecessary "throws"
	clauses.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/ReportRunner.java: removed try/catch since
	Report.run never throws an exception.

	* jimm/datavision/ErrorHandler.java: improved error reporting:
	accept message and Throwable; always print error message to
	System.err; always print stack trace when handed a Throwable;
	print to System.err before showing dialog so output doesn't have
	to wait until the user dismisses the dialog.

2002-01-08  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.1.1 released.

	* datavision.bat: fixed what was an essentially useless script.

2002-01-07  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Utils.java (generateNewId): factored out of
	Field and Formula and moved here.

	* jimm/datavision/Field.java: use Utils.generateNewId().

	* jimm/datavision/Formula.java: use Utils.generateNewId().

2002-01-06  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java: added new dtdVersion attribute.

	* jimm/datavision/ReportReader.java: use setters instead of
	directly accessing values; this lets observers start observing
	properly. Remember XML DTD version number so we can perform
	conversions when necessary.
	(report): read and remember new dtd-version attribute.
	(formula): convert formulas in old-style XML files.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FormulaWin.java (update): if the formula
	changes, refresh the formula code.

	* jimm/datavision/Formula.java: observe all formulas referenced
	within this formula (and pass on all updates to those objects
	observing this formula).

	* jimm/datavision/testdata/oracle/CreateData.java: add one to
	month number.

	* jimm/datavision/testdata/postgres/CreateData.java: add one to
	month number.

	* jimm/datavision/testdata/Job.java (constructor): set job id; all
	ids were previously 0.

2002-01-05  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FieldWidget.java (addCustomPopupItems):
	added this method so subclasses like FormulaWidget can add new
	popup menu items.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FormulaWidget.java: Added menu items and
	methods to support editing and renaming from the popup menu.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DbConnWin.java: added database name field.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java: removed host and port
	parameters.

	* jimm/datavision/ReportReader.java (database): removed host and
	port parameters.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (writeXML): if description is null,
	write an empty string instead of "null".
	(askForPassword): removed host and port parameters.

	* jimm/datavision/sql/Database.java (writeXML): if database name
	is null, write an empty string instead of "null".

2002-01-01  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/TextField.java (setValue): check string
	contents, not object equivalence, when assigning a new value.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/TextFieldWidget.java (mouseClicked): call
	super instead of duplicating code.

2001-12-31  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/SubtotalField.java (updateSubtotal): renamed
	from udpate because we are now an Observer of the field we are
	subtotaling.
	(getField): lazily instantiates fieldToSubtotal because when we
	are constructed that field may not yet exist. Also starts
	observing that field so we can detect name changes.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (updateSubtotals): call the newly-
	renamed SubtotalField.updateSubtotal (formerly named
	SubtotalField.update).

	* jimm/datavision/gui/TextFieldWidget.java (startEditing): stop
	listening to mouse so editing works as expected.
	(endEditing): start listening again.

2001-12-28  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/*.java: make pretty much everything Observable.
	This makes GUI updating a heck of a lot easier. For example, when
	a formula name gets changed it will automagically be updated
	everywhere.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/TextFieldWidget.java (startEditing): when we
	start editing, select this field and deselect all others.

	* examples/report1.xml: formula now has id attribute, formula
	field now uses the formula's id instead of its name.

	* jimm/datavision/Formula.java (constructors): the name should not
	be a formula's unique identifier; use id numbers instead. That
	way, when we change a formula's name we don't change its identity.
	(formulaString): use id number, not name of formula.

	* jimm/datavision/Join.java: removed "null" and "not null" from
	RELATIONS list because those don't define a join between columns.

2001-12-27  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/gui/VisTableWin.java: display all database
	fields, not just those in tables used by the query.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (init): initialize the report's
	query instead of leaving it null.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DesignWin.java (DesignWin): tell
	openDbConnWin to use a WindowRaiser.
	(openDbConnWin): use a WindowRaiser if requested.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/WindowRaiser.java: created so we can
	automagically raise windows that appear behind others; for
	example, the DbConnWin window appears under a new report design
	window even though we created it later and called setVisible(true)
	later.

2001-12-24  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/gui/AskStringDialog.java: created so we can ask
	for and edit the names of formulas.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/DbPasswordDialog.java: renamed from the
	almost equally untypable DatabasePasswordDialog.java.

2001-12-23  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Field.java: added methods to this superclass
	and all subclasses that return true if this field refers to
	other specific fields or formulas.

	* jimm/datavision/Section.java: added methods for reporting on use
	of fields and formulas in the section.

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java: added methods for reporting on use
	of fields and formulas in the report.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FPLeafInfo.java: moved tree's leaf info
	nodes out of FieldPickerWin.java and renamed them.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/Draggable.java: created this interface for
	objects that can be dragged between windows (for example, fields,
	formulas, parameters, and database columns).

2001-12-21  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* docs/copyImages.rb: created to edit image URLs and copy image
	files into docs/DataVision/images.

	* docs/Makefile: changed args to latex2html to generate fewer,
	flatter HTML files.

2001-12-20  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* jimm/datavision/Report.java (contains): added for detecting
	a field within the report.

	* jimm/datavision/Section.java (contains): added for detecting
	a field within the section.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FieldPickerWin.java: added menu bar and
	actions for creating, editing, and deleting formulas and
	parameters. The latter are still disabled until we implement
	parameters.

	* Makefile (SRC): added FocusSetter.java.

	* jimm/datavision/gui/FocusSetter.java (FocusSetter): tell timer
	to execute only once.

2001-12-18  Jim Menard  <jimm@io.com>

	* Version 0.1.0 released
